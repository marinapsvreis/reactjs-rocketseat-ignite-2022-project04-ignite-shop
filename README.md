## About

- Ignite Shop is an e-commerce platform where we have a list of products (shirts) to be sold.
- In this project, I had the opportunity to improve the application taught during Module 4 of Rocketseat's React.js 2022.
- During the classes, the main objective was to learn how to use Stitches, the Stripe API, and all of this in conjunction with the trending technology of the moment, Next.js.
- For the challenge, I added Radix-UI, Skeleton, Phospor React, and Embla Carousel React.

After the end of the lessons, the application went directly from the product page, and the Stripe checkout was only performed there through the "buy product" button.
The challenge afterwards was to implement a shopping cart in this application and obtain the Stripe checkout screen with the list of products added to the cart.

To run the project, you can use the following command: ```npm run dev```
